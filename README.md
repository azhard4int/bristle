Bristle has one sole purpose: Benchmarking various Python 3 libraries for the IO bound work.

We will be doing comparison and benchmark for the following libraires:

- [ ] threading
- [ ] multi-processing
- [ ] gevent
- [ ] twisted
- [ ] asyncio

Benchmark for different libraries:

| Processing        | Requests           | Time  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Threading/10 threads      | 100 | 22.2s |
| Threading/50 threads    | 1000      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
